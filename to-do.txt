## Plan

DONE:
- set up standard operators
- function to make tensor products with trivial operators
- function to check linear independence (rank=#operators iff rows linearly dependent)
- function to build closed lie algebras (with cut off)
- function to extend lie algebra with commutations of another lie algebra
- turn into Python script, make folder pretty
- commutation function

TO DO:
- create tests from examples in paper
- function to check linear independence via QR decomp
- function returning linear decomposition of an operator into Lie algebra operators
- function reducing list of operators to minimal set of linearly independent operators


##### Problems

FIXED:
- original Ops in complete_algebra need to be linearly independent: check "complete_algebra([X, X], 5)"

NOT FIXED:
- cannot determine how an operator is linearly dependent on operators in algebra (use qr decomp: cols of r give dependencies)
- final Lie algebra is list of huge matrices, not their tensor decomposition (way to simplify down from linear dependencies?)
